# SQL-Database-Data-Entry
I Conducted a series of test using java (jdbc) to enter a chunk of data (5000 rows) using different methodologies to see which ones work best for which conditions, there is a word file in there to check the results and choose your method appropriate for your applications, if you would like to test it for yourself the complete project is in there, all you have to do is read it into your eclipse using filesystem and then link up jdbc jar file and then simply run.
